            <p class="justify">When you go to make an online purchase, what’s the first thing you do? In an
                ecommerce-driven
                world where customers can’t physically experience products before purchasing, many consumers turn to
                online
                product reviews. As online review sites such as Yelp! and Facebook have expanded,finding an opinion on
                just
                about anything is only a few clicks away. The proliferation of reviews has even gone so far as to shape
                how
                businesses are perceived online.</p>

                <p> Online shopping is a process whereby consumers directly buy goods, services etc. from a seller
                    without
                    an intermediary service over the Internet. Shoppers can visit web stores from the comfort of their
                    house
                    and shop as by sitting in front of the computer.</p>

                <h3 class="orange">Online shopping | 2017-2022</h3>
                <p>A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view
                    photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features
                    and
                    prices. Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models,
                    brands
                    or items.</p>
