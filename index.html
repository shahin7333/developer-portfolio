            <p id="justify">When you go to make an online purchase, what’s the first thing you do? In an
                ecommerce-driven
                world where customers can’t physically experience products before purchasing, many consumers turn to
                online
                product reviews. As online review sites such as Yelp! and Facebook have expanded,finding an opinion on
                just
                about anything is only a few clicks away. The proliferation of reviews has even gone so far as to shape
                how
                businesses are perceived online.</p>
